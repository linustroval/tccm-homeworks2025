# Project 4: MacMurchie-Davidson Scheme

## Description
This project implements a program to compute the overlap matrix for a diatomic molecule using the MacMurchie-Davidson algorithm, as part of the Molecular Quantum Mechanics course.

## Directory Structure
- **src/**: Contains all Fortran source codes (modules and main programs).
- **tests/**: Contains the basis set input files required for testing.
- **INSTALL.md**: Instructions for compiling and running the code.
- **AUTHORS**: List of contributors.

## Features
- **Exercise 3.1**: Transformation from spherical to Cartesian Gaussians.
- **Exercise 3.2**: Calculation of overlap norms using explicit formulas.
- **Exercise 3.3**: Full overlap matrix calculation for diatomic molecules using the recursive MacMurchie-Davidson scheme.
